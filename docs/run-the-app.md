# Run the app
To run the application we use an object method already instantiated by Flet-Easy (you can customize the parameters of your method according to your needs):

## ðŸ“· **Demo**
![FletEasy run](assets/images/method_run.png "FletEasy run")

## customize as it is executed
![run view](assets/images/run_view.png "run view")

## Use with fastapi
![run fastapi](assets/images/fastapi_run.png "run fastapi")

## Export asgi app
![Export asgi](assets/images/export_asgi.png "Export asgi")

???+ info "If you have any problem in `build Web`"
     Use:
     ```python
     ft.app(target=app.run(fastapi=true))
     ```
